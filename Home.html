            <h1>"Tea gardens to the Teapot"</h1>
            <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis,<br>
            an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Burma.

                    <h3>BLACK TEA</h3>
                    <p>Black tea gets withered, fully oxidized, and dried for a remarkably long time. This high level of oxidation is black tea’s defining feature, giving it both its dark look and potent aroma. The standard flavor profile of black tea is strong, brisk, and full-bodied, with varying degrees of maltiness or fruitiness.</p>

                <div class="product-col">
                    <h3>GREEN TEA</h3>
                    <p>Green tea is mainly produced in China and Japan. Each of these countries has its own signature way of making its green tea. Chinese green teas get pan-fried with dry heat to prevent oxidation, whereas Japanese green teas get steam-fried with wet heat. These two processes produce strikingly different results that make it easy to recognize which region a green tea comes from.</p>

                <div class="product-col">
                    <h3>WHITE TEA</h3>
                    <p>Due to this delicate process, white tea boasts a unique, sweet aroma and a soft, fresh flavor that tastes straight from the garden. Although similar to green tea, white tea is typically creamier, sweeter, and softer than green tea. White tea doesn’t become bitter or astringent easily, so you don’t need to be too careful about how you steep it. How long you do so determines its caffeine level.</p>

                    <h3>OOLONG TEA</h3>
                    <p>This lighter oxidation process gives oolong tea a fresh taste with a distinct flavor dependent on where the tea leaves were grown. Most oolong tea comes from Taiwan and China. One popular oolong tea comes from the Chinese tea-producing provinces in the Wuyi Mountains and Anxi. Taiwan is most known for its specialty oolong teas like Milk Oolong.</p>

                <div class="product-col">
                    <h3>YELLOW TEA</h3>
                    <p>This drawn-out drying process gives yellow tea a mild taste somewhere between the flavor profiles of green and white tea. While yellow tea has the same mellow flavor as green, it has a smoother taste and a more fruity and floral aroma. In this way, yellow tea’s flavors match its bright appearance.</p>

                    <h3>PU-ERH TEA</h3>
                    <p>Pu-erh is most famous for its rich, earthy flavor. While raw pu-erh can have a range of flavors depending on how far along it is in the aging process, the flavor variations for ripe pu-erh are more limited. In general, pu-erh has a smooth, floral, and earthy taste with a full-bodied texture.</p>
